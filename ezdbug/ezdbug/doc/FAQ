eZ DBug extension v0.0.1 FAQ

1. DBug API Support
=================================================

1.1 Dbug Resources
=================================================

2. Referencs
=================================================
* Portions of the 'DBug' extension are based on the 
  'dBug' class. http://dbug.ospinto.com/

**  "It's a class that displays structured information 
    about a variable in a colored tabular format. 

    Simply put, it's PHP's var_dump function on steroids. 
    If you have ever used ColdFusion you would certainly 
    agree with me that its tag (cfdump) has a much better 
    representation/output of a variable and its contents 
    than PHP's var_dump which only outputs horrible 
    <strike>structured</strike> information. 

    It's very difficult to view at a glance the contents of 
    a large array with var_dump. Well, dBug is the the 
    equivalent of PHP's cfdump. ColdFusion programmers would 
    be happy to note that the same color scheme is used as 
    the default scheme for dBug. 

    And well, PHP programmers would be happy to note that 
    they can at last see contents of a variable much easier with dBug."
