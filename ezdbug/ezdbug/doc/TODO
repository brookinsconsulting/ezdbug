eZ DBug extension v0.0.2 TODO
=================================================

There are still quite a lot of features we would
like to add to eZ DBug

A few users of eZ DBug may require further
extension of the default eZ publish development features.

* eZ publish based example uses
* eZpedia.org documentation
* Add default dump display to display in collapsed state
* Add ezlog support for custom eZ log
* Add optional argument (default to no) call die() after debug has been displayed.

If you are interested in sponsoring the development
of any of these features for your eZ publish web site,
please contact info@brookinsconsulting.com
