eZ DBug extension v0.0.2 TODO
=================================================

There are still quite a lot of features we would
like to add to eZ DBug

A few users of eZ DBug may require further
extension of the default eZ publish development features.

* eZ publish based example uses
* eZpedia.org documentation

* Add default dump display to display in collapsed state
* Add ezlog support for custom eZ log
* Add optional argument (default to no) call die() after debug has been displayed.

* Add support for display as debug toolbar item.
* Add support for display of debug to respect existing debugbyip settings
* Add features provided by, 'lib/eztemplate/classes/eztemplateattributeoperator.php'
* Add important feature: hovering over any field should show actual variable 
  to use in template to get that value or some other way, point is that once
  you have navigated to the value that interests you in this folding tree you
  could copy-paste the variable to use from there, paste it in template and bang get value.

If you are interested in sponsoring the development
of any of these features for your eZ publish web site,
